Any help required with git - https://medium.freecodecamp.org/follow-these-simple-rules-and-youll-become-a-git-and-github-master-e1045057468f

-
THIS IS OUR MAIN APPLICATION.
-

Pull this repository into your local repo using ' $ git pull origin master ' command on the git bash opened in your local repo.

..........

To start developing the project in Ionic directly, find all the necessary information in this thread -
https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/2361

...........


These few rules will help us maintain the project and use the resources provided by git completely.

-> Create a new branch for every new changes. DO NOT MAKE CHANGES DIRECTLY IN THE MAIN BRANCH. If the code doesn't work, it will ruin the 
already existing and working piece of code, that we have already developed.
Create new branch for everytime you develop the code for something new, and of the code works perfectly fine, merge the branch with master.

-> Use proper pull requests to merge with the origin.

-> Pull the latest changes in the repo everytime, before you start developing and Push the code at the end of your work. Everytime.

-> Use proper IDENTATION !

-> Use COMMENTS !

-> Use the branch names, variable names, function names, etc in a proper way such that the crew can understand what that thing does, just by 
reading the name.
